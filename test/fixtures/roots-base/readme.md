Roots Base Template
-------------------

The default template that ships with [roots](https://github.com/jenius/roots). Uses [jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade), [stylus](https://github.com/learnboost/stylus), and [coffeescript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script), along with [axis](https://github.com/jenius/axis), [autoprefixer](https://github.com/jenius/autoprefixer-stylus), and [rupture](https://github.com/jenius/rupture) stylus plugins and [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) compile and minify client-side js.

All these settings can be easily swapped for other preferences you might have in `app.coffee`. And if you have a variation on this template you like, you should [make your own template](#) and open source it to the world! You can even [make it the default](#) in roots. Everyone has different preferences and that's great - this is just a place for you to get started.
